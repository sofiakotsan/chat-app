### How it works
- If you are starting to use this app for the first time - you will need to create a username on the start screen. It should be at least 3 symbols long and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. The username gets saved to your local storage. During the next login, the app will automatically pull your username from storage and complete authentification.
- Every user gets assigned a random color. This color changes after every login.
- After successful login you can start chatting. You will only see messages that will be sent after your login. Previous chat history does not get saved.
-  There is a list of connected users in the left chat panel (desktop version) / or in the menu (mobile and tablet versions). You can perform a search by username in the search bar above the user list. You can also tag a user by clicking on their username in the user list or in a message header or content.
